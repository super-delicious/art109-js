    <strong>Technical Exercise 6:</strong>
    <br>
    Intro to JavaScript
  </h1>
  <p>

  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Part 1:
  </h2>
  <p>
    Read <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html">Chapter 2</a> of Eloquent JavaScript book and complete the exercises at the bottom. The exercises are repeated below. For each exercise, write a new script that completes the
    task, save each as there own name. <br>
  <h3>
    Exercises
  </h3>
  <h4>
    Looping Triangle
  </h4>
  <p>
    Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:
  </p>
  <pre>
#
##
###
####
#####
######
#######
    </pre>
  <h4>
    FizzBuzz
  </h4>
  <p>
    Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
    <br><br>
    When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).
  </p>
  <h4>
    Chessboard
  </h4>
  <p>
    Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
    <br><br>
    Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:
    <br>
  </p>
  <pre>
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
 # # # #
# # # #
    </pre>
  <p>
    When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding size = 8 and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
    <br><br>
    You will have 3 scripts in total at the end of Part 1.
  </p>
  <br>
  <h2>
    Part 2:
  </h2>
  <p>
    In order to begin exploring how JavaScript interacts with HTML, you will create a new simple HTML page. On the page, use at least one h1 tag, one p tag and one button. Add a script to the page that generates an alert window when you click the
    button.
    <br><br>
    The alert documentation can be found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_alert.asp">HERE</a> and adding a script within and HTML document is explained <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_whereto.asp">HERE</a>.
    <br><br>
    <strong>You should have 3 JS files and 1 HTML file with embedded JS at the end of this exercise.</strong>
